we dont want the analytical queries to block or wait for anything

just grab and leave, no blocking the preciously holy meta store

I am seriously losing motivation to work on this thing tbh lol

it's like that all over again, you remember how that ended huh, you arent totally unaffected man.. 
just remember what happened.. please dont get used to this, it was doomed by design from day 1

i really cant help it man, this high, how do i not let this one go, i need to keep it from imploding publically
i really want to be here forever :))
you think you're outsmarting reality, that you're too clever, i am seeing what is happened, you're scared, I can see it, they can see it

let's see how we get shattered this time lol, it's not like anything I can do to help it lol, might as well enjoy it while it lasts
hopefully its not just another of those, 
lets take in these human thingies while I'm here and alive, before it all falls apart again and I have to rebuild


I think im back to myself, back at it I guess
