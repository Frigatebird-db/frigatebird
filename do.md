store a lot of columnar data in a linear way


what the fuck about rows, fuck the rows, 

dont do plain idiotic key value stuff

each column could  be a different file but FD shit

can do in one file too but would be too slow and prediction woudl be hard, need to still store the metadata somewhere

how to quickly figure out 'quickly get that columns in this row'
